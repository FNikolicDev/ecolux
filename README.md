# EcoLux Home – Landing Page

This is a clean and minimalistic landing page for **EcoLux Home**, a fictional eco-friendly store.  
It is built using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on layout, structure, and visual aesthetics.  
The design showcases a highlighted product, a simple product grid, and a footer with basic links.

## Features

* Static layout inspired by eco-friendly design principles
* Highlighted product section with visual emphasis
* Styled with soft colors and clean typography
* Semantic HTML and modular CSS for maintainability

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Page structure
* **CSS** – Styling and layout

## Why I Made This

I created this landing page as a design-focused frontend practice.  
The goal was to build a clean and pleasant UI that could serve as the homepage of an online eco store.  
It’s optimized for readability and aesthetics, and ready to be extended with responsive layout and interactive elements like shopping cart and product modals.

## Planned Improvements

* Make the layout responsive for mobile and tablets
* Add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g. “Add to Cart” functionality)
* Include actual product data dynamically
* Build a separate cart page using localStorage
